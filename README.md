# SysAgent
SysAgent is a lightweight and efficient monitoring agent designed to collect system metrics from servers and workstations. It works alongside SysMonitor, the central API, to provide real-time insights into system performance.

## Features

✅ Collects CPU, memory, disk, and network usage metrics  
✅ Supports multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS)  
✅ Sends data securely to the SysMonitor API  
✅ Low resource consumption for minimal system impact  
✅ Configurable collection intervals  

## How It Works
1️⃣ SysAgent gathers system metrics at regular intervals  
2️⃣ Sends the data to SysMonitor via REST API, WebSockets, or another configured protocol  
3️⃣ SysMonitor processes and stores the metrics for analysis and visualization
